Claymore v0.0.0.0.1a

DISCLAIMER: This script is craptacular. It may work well, it may kill
you, kill your family, and do unspeakable things to your network. It
may not work at all!

It's fairly basic. All the configuration for the AP and DHCP should be 
done by you. All the script does is monitor your logfile for DHCPACK 
events.

I would suggest you not run this on a production DHCP server. 

Config stuff is in claymore.ini.dist -- Edit this file, save the valid 
config as claymore.ini it will not work without it.

Assumes you have python-daemon and python-nmap installed

Also assumes you've installed it in /opt/claymore, if it's somewhere else, 
change the claymore.ini path given to the claymore() function in 
claymored.py

to run: python claymored.py

It will detatch and run as a daemon.

Good luck!
